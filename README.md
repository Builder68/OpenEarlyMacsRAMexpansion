# OpenEarlyMacsRAMexpansion

Summary
Unlike the Macintosh Plus, which offers a simple SIMM-based memory upgrade, expanding the memory of these early Macs is significantly more complex and requires additional components.
Historically, RAM expansion boards were available to increase the memory of early Macs. However, finding these boards in working condition has become increasingly challenging and expensive. The Mac Rescue boards, capable of reaching 4MB, are particularly rare.
This newly designed expansion board, paired with an auxiliary board, provides a flexible and customizable solution to increase memory up to 4MB. The circuitry is largely based on the renowned Macsnap 548E (1.5 MB RAM) expansion board from DOVE Inc. With minor modifications and enhancements, 4MB RAM is easily achievable using newer, higher-density DRAM FP ICs.
